# gcp-cups-x

Holding pen for some minor extensions / modifications to [Google's cups-connector], motivated by using this on a Raspberry Pi.

Note that I'm using this with a few changes to the [instructions on the project wiki]. Specifically, I'm consistently
using `gcp-cups` for directory (in `/etc`, `/opt`, and `/var/log`) and service names.
